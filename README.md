# ESP32-OpenCV-Projects

OpenCV applications for ESP32

## Introduction

This project is based on joachimBurket/esp32-opencv(https://github.com/joachimBurket/esp32-opencv)
Based on what he worked on, I try to not only upgrade all components but also make an OpenCV application for ESP32.

## How to make a build environment
