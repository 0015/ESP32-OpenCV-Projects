# ESP32 OpenCV Projects

Running OpenCV on ESP32 as a standalone

## Introduction

This project is based on joachimBurket/esp32-opencv(https://github.com/joachimBurket/esp32-opencv)
Based on what he worked on, I try to not only upgrade all components but also make an OpenCV application for ESP32.

## How to make a build environment

First of all, the ESP-IDF development environment should be ready in advance.

## OpenCV Applications for ESP32 

It's RGB Pixel Detector & drawing Histogram. In the image obtained from the camera, the center RGB pixel information is displayed, and the histogram of the entire image is displayed.
